1. **Q: How does the HALO app implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?**

   **A:**
   HALO uses a two-step RAG pipeline:
   - First, it extracts and summarizes goal history data from the database.
   - Then, it embeds these summaries using OpenAI embeddings and stores them in a Chroma vector database.
   - At runtime, when a user asks a question, the backend retrieves the most relevant chunks from the vector DB and passes them as context to the Azure OpenAI LLM via LangChain.
   - This enables the AI to generate answers grounded in the user's actual financial data.

2. **Q: How are environment variables managed securely in HALO?**

   **A:**
   - All sensitive credentials (Twilio, Azure OpenAI, database, etc.) are stored in a `.env` file.
   - The `.env` file is loaded using `python-dotenv` in Python and by the React app for frontend configuration.
   - The `.env` file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of secrets.

3. **Q: How does the frontend communicate with the backend?**

   **A:**
   - The React frontend makes HTTP requests to the FastAPI backend (typically at `http://localhost:8000`).
   - For AI chat, it sends a POST request to `/api/ai-chat` with the chat history, and receives a response generated by the backend's RAG pipeline.

4. **Q: What happens if the embedding or vector DB initialization fails?**

   **A:**
   - HALO's backend wraps the RAG pipeline initialization in a try/except block.
   - If embeddings or the vector DB cannot be initialized (e.g., due to missing credentials or service outage), the app does not crash.
   - Instead, it sets a flag and returns a friendly fallback message to the user, indicating that retrieval-augmented answers are temporarily unavailable.

5. **Q: How does HALO send SMS notifications?**

   **A:**
   - HALO uses the Twilio API to send SMS messages.
   - The backend loads Twilio credentials from environment variables and uses the `twilio` Python package to send messages, such as motivational updates or goal progress notifications.
