Technologies Used
----------------

**Frontend:**
- React (JavaScript) for a responsive, interactive user interface
- CSS-in-JS and inline styles for custom UI/UX
- Fetch API for communication with the backend

**Backend:**
- FastAPI (Python) for building RESTful APIs
- SQLAlchemy for ORM-based database access
- LangChain for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs
- OpenAI/Azure OpenAI for AI-generated, personalized messaging
- Twilio for sending SMS notifications and reminders

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage of clients, goals, and history

**Vector Database:**
- Chroma for storing and retrieving embedded goal history chunks

**DevOps/Deployment:**
- Docker for containerization and cross-platform compatibility
- dotenv for secure environment variable management


Strengths / Where HALO Excels
----------------------------

- **Personalized AI Messaging:** Uses Azure OpenAI to generate fresh, motivational, and context-aware messages for each user.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines user data with LLMs to provide answers grounded in real financial history.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Docker setup and line-ending normalization ensure smooth operation on both Windows and Mac.
- **User Engagement:** SMS reminders and milestone celebrations keep users motivated and on track.
- **Security Best Practices:** Sensitive credentials are managed via environment variables and not committed to source control.


Limitations
-----------

- **API Rate Limits:** Dependent on Azure OpenAI and Twilio quotas, which may restrict usage under heavy load or free tiers.
- **Single-User/Small Team Focus:** Current design is best suited for individuals or small advisory teams; multi-tenant or enterprise features would require further development.
- **No Real-Time Collaboration:** The app does not currently support real-time updates or multi-user collaboration on the same account.
- **Limited Analytics:** Out-of-the-box analytics and reporting are basic; advanced insights would require additional modules.
- **Manual Data Ingestion:** Goal and client data must be seeded or entered manually; no integrations with external financial data sources yet.


Future Enhancements
-------------------

- **Multi-Tenancy & Role-Based Access:** Support for multiple advisors, clients, and permission levels.
- **Advanced Analytics & Reporting:** Dashboards for trends, projections, and actionable insights.
- **Integration with Financial APIs:** Automatic syncing with banks, investment accounts.
- **More Advanced Chatbot Features:** Including voice support and proactive suggestions.
- **Customizable Messaging:** Allow users/advisors to customize the tone, frequency, and content of AI messages.
- **Localization & Accessibility:** Support for multiple languages and enhanced accessibility features.
- **Enhanced Security:** Features like 2FA, audit logs, and compliance with financial data regulations.


Summary
-------

HALO is a robust, extensible platform for AI-driven financial goal management, with a modern tech stack and a strong foundation for future growth. Its strengths are in personalized engagement and AI integration, while future work can focus on scalability, automation, and deeper analytics.
